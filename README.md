# facerecognitionbrain

A fun React app that detects faces in your images! Make sure to enter a URL for an image address, 
because it will not be able to detect faces in a base64 image address.

The Node.js server for this React app is deployed on Heroku and goes into sleep mode when not in use, 
so upon first sign in and first face detect there may be a slight delay. 
After that it should work be plenty quick and responsive!
